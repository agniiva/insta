Non-Focused Messaging & Wrong Channel can “kill” your business.

Product Owners & Business often complain about their Growth.

I’ll share my growth strategy that can 5x-7x your growth in next 6 months.

(Don’t believe me? Try it yourself)

Most product owners focuses upon irrelevant vanity metrics such as “Traffic”, “Clicks”, “impressions” & what not. 

🚧 Sorry to burst your bubble. These secondary metrics which are useful to make informed decisions but these by themselves doesn’t talk about Growth.

Your primary metrics should always be any form of predictable value in your customer journey (leads & sales) In B2B sector.

Any form of optimisation on those will have smaller metrics. 

Uk a cinematography professor of mine used to often say, “People who spoke about fps, bitrates are not creative & they try compensate using these information.”

… I’ve worked with multiple clients & they often show me their traffic, CTR but in reality the ROI from that metrics aren’t justified, u’ll see either there are no funnel trying to get rev out of it!

I’d even argue if 10x Traffic won’t even make them 2x revenue 😂

This is what they fail to realise:
- Excessive ToFU marketing will give you traffic, but the Conversion Rate drops.
- They focus too much on Traffic (page visits) as metrics but fail to convert then to Leads.
- They spend excessively on a certain channel where they do get leads but because their messaging “sucks” they attract the wrong audience.
- The objective of B2B marketing is Increase high quality leads. (full stop)

🛑 The focus of marketing is not only to Increase (n)Lead Acquisition but also put a strategy in place to churn more CLV out of existing customers.

So what are the metrics should you actually care about: (From Marketing)
- High Quality Leads
- Ideas to improve CLV
