I remember the first time I watched one

of your reels there's a chain there's a

cool shirt here I was like wait this is

the head of Instagram and I'm into it

what is the competition for Tik Tok hurt

us but it hurt them way more where does

Instagram lie on Revenue share creators

are tough to keep happy does like watch

time matter people ask a lot about the

algorithm I didn't anticipate that

answer from you what's one of your

interests gardening and planting food in

my backyard all right cool Tik Tok is is

gone from the US what does that mean for

Instagram

I mean today on the Colin beer show

we're joined by head of Instagram Adam

misseri Adam joined Facebook in 2008 as

a product designer and eventually became

the head of Instagram in 2018 we came up

to the Instagram Offices here in San

Francisco and started our conversation

with Adam about what type of content

performs best on Instagram we also

talked about the race to remain

competitive with Tik Tok and YouTube and

asked Adam about his perspective on

creater monetization and revenue sharing

on Instagram it's a really fun and eye-

opening conversation that covers a ton

of ground I think you guys are going to

really enjoy it and if you're watching

here on YouTube make sure to subscribe

here's our conversation with head of

Instagram Adam

[Music]

masseri Adam welcome to the show thanks

for having me the first thing we wanted

to ask you is you're the head of

Instagram um and we were trying to think

in our head like what what does that job

mean like what does your day-to-day look

like

it's a very strange gig you know in the

same day I might talk to a policy maker

about a very serious safety issue I

might talk about the relative allocation

of CPUs and gpus in

2026 I might then have to record

something explaining a new ranking

update or a new feature that we're

launching and then have a one-on-one

with someone who's really mad at me for

some reason and try to figure out why

and how I can do better and that might

all be before lunch so it's very

schizophrenic how do you get to that

point where you now have this very

varied job but you started as a product

designer with Facebook yeah I'm curious

what does it take to number one grow

with someone like Mark Zuckerberg for so

many years and rise in the ranks

essentially to get to this point I think

it was mostly just because I was

reliable I wasn't very good I just have

a lot of range so I'm a decent at a

strangely large number of things and I

think that has really helped me that

helped me in my transition from product

design into product management where

being more of a generalist I think is

more advantageous and then into being an

executive again it's a very generalist

type role to the what we were talking

about before because of the range so my

career really accelerated when I leaned

into that and was honest about what I

wasn't good at is there an element

though of like being able to develop a

relationship specifically with Mark

Zuckerberg someone that clearly you know

well work closely with with you know to

lead Instagram I would imagine you must

have some ability to like work well

right and to pair well yeah I think you

need I mean for any with any boss to

work for them as long as you I have

worked for Mark you need to have some

level

of not just relationship but trust um

but I do think

that with Mark Mark is very consistent

um he is always going to hold a really

really high bar he's always going to

push you really really hard he's always

going to have very high

expectations um and you can you can kind

of when you've worked with anybody for

long enough start to anticipate sort of

what their feedback is going to be what

they care about and so as long as you

make sure you Embrace that in addition

to embracing whatever you believe in and

how to you want to approach the role you

have to find that balance and I think

with

Mark I we have that balance most of the

time I mean we argue a decent amount we

argued a lot in the early years I

remember um pushing back a lot on a

number of random unimportant design

specifics in like 2009 um probably not

good career

advice I look back at my 26y old hot

head self um but over the time like you

build up that trust and where did some

of that tension come from back then of

like what were you fighting for what was

he fighting for like what what does he

care about and what do you care about

about I mean I think those fights were

probably a little bit less principled I

was probably just being a pain in the

ass he was very results focused and I

was I cared about things I still care

about now but I was I didn't care enough

about other things and I think what he

was doing was pushing me hard on the

things that I didn't care about enough

that I should have cared about do you

feel responsible

for Mark's new

style no but I love it I love when I

started seeing him with the chain I was

like he might be hanging out with Adam a

lot yeah the chain is good oh man the

chain is a whole thing there's so many

stories the whole thing I remember the

first time I watched one of your reels

that's kind of how I came across you for

the first time was one of your own reels

oh yeah yeah I was like wait this is the

head of Instagram I was like wait one of

these is not like the other like

comparing you against the other like

Tech leaders I was like there's a chain

there's a cool shirt here what's

happening I'm a big soccer fan this is

zadan um look I think that for a long

time he embraced not using not wasting

any energy on deciding what to wear

every day so he wor like the same thing

every day for a long time as a lot of

tech execs have done over the years and

over the last couple years he's started

to explore expressing himself and I'm

into it I'm totally into it I think

clothes are fun uh so I'm I'm very

supportive yeah uh and also to get memed

like that with the whole beard thing

what I mean you guys spent a lot of time

on the internet how many memes are

positive about a public figure yeah

totally it's such a rare thing and I

think also just like being a fun part of

the conversation is is so great and

you've been that right I've been Meed

I've never been Meed in a nice way I've

only been MD in the standard way it

could happen there's still time all

right I've given upen today who knows

we'll

see um so obviously so much has changed

since that era I mean I come from the

mypace era I put all my band's music on

MySpace unfortunately it's gone forever

now yeah like I can't access that music

anymore um but we come from that era I

from the the Friendster Myspace era into

into Facebook into Instagram um and

Instagram today is is a very different

place than you know it was obviously

when it first started and what the

internet was like when we first started

being creators the only place to really

post video when we first started in 2011

was uh YouTube and Vimeo those were kind

of the two primary did you guys do a lot

with Vimeo back in the day he uploaded

his first videos yeah I was very uh

invested in Vimeo I felt like this is a

true place for artists and filmm yeah

yeah well that's sort of like the design

aesthetic Vibe kind of thing he he

brought me over to YouTube but I was

he's like I care about the results my my

identity was W he was yeah he was

interested in the results I was wrapped

up in being the artist yeah

unfortunately we also came from the era

where like you know the social network

the movie came out and I think we were

just like this is what we have to do we

have to build a a thing and try and get

it acquired that was like the the

modernization of the American dream was

kind of uh perpetuated by by the story

of Facebook right and I think that being

a young person coming out of college

during that time that was the thing it

was like where are we going to build an

audience and how are we gonna um build

something of scale and you were right

and I I guess we were right Vimeo versus

YouTube we were right on YouTube we made

the right move yeah uh but today

obviously there's there's uh an

unbelievable amount of places to to post

video to build audience um I'm just

curious to to dig into the world of

Instagram today uh and and how much

video has changed oh a lot yeah a lot I

mean I think that when people think of

Instagram and you've known Instagram or

you've been on Instagram for a while you

almost always think of a feed of square

photos maybe hypers saturated you know

just maybe a little bit too airbrushed

or you know Landscapes but if actually

you look how people use Instagram it's

just changed dramatically and I

understand that as we evolve Instagram

forward it can be really frustrating

because people get used to using an app

in one way and if it changes underneath

them that can be

annoying but if you think about if we

had stuck with a feed of square photos

and we didn't have stories and we didn't

have DMS and we didn't have videos or

reels we wouldn't be anywhere near as

relevant as we are today I think the

biggest risk that any platform like ours

faces is that the world as it continues

to change faster and faster gets away

from you and you just become irrelevant

because you can't keep up and if you

push too hard and you change too quickly

that can backfire and we've had that

happen and if but if you don't take

enough risk and you are too attached to

the Past then you're just going to

slowly become irrelevant and that's a

balance and so you are asking about

video video is a huge part of what we do

now it's more than half the amount of

time spent on Instagram as video at this

point in most countries it's not the

only thing we do we try to do it

differently than YouTube and Tik Tok uh

where I think it's a bit more of a

laid-back passive experience we try to

create a bit more of a participatory

leanin experience one where you're G to

discover a real and then send it to a

friend and then talk about it with

another friend and um but it's still a

huge part of what we do because it's a

huge there's a huge amount of demand and

at the end of the day we're a business

we have to figure out a way to meet

demand as demand moves around and shifts

actually think that's the biggest

differentiator when we talk about video

on Instagram and even when as creators

when we're producing a video for

Instagram that we know is going to be

distrib on Instagram we look at it as a

unit of conversation right like video on

Instagram is so different because of the

DMS it's huge it is such a different

experience because you're essentially

building something if it's successful

then we see that the shares go up right

and that suggests that its success is

determined by someone watching it and

needing to send it to a friend to

connect and it all happens on one

platform right like the the expectation

on Instagram is that I can create

something and everyone from my niece or

nephew to my parents to uh you know a

Creator right a professional Creator can

watch this and we find over and over

again that that ends up being the mo the

healthiest thing to value in the ranking

models people ask a lot about the

algorithms feel like it's a black box

everyone's always feels like they

deserve more reach than they get and

sometimes that's the case but one of the

most important things to look at if

you're trying to evaluate how your

videos or anything is doing on Instagram

is definitely the sends sends I would

look at sends per reach um so of the

people who saw it how many of them sent

it to a friend um because that tends to

be the content that does the best

because it tends to drive the most value

for the overall Community you see

something that you think what what's one

of your

interests uh lately I've been getting

into like gardening and planting food in

my backyard so all right right cool so

let's say you guys I just harvested some

basil is what I'm saying so my best

friend is a has a huge Green Thumb so

we're going to use him as IND this

example instead of me because I would

not like that thing at all but if you

did a whole if you saw some amazing

basil planting video maybe some sort of

time lapse right and you sent that to my

buddy

hondro that is an interesting moment

because you discovered something that

someone made something creative

something beautiful something

interesting and then you shared it with

a friend in this hypothetical world you

and HRA are also buds of course and then

he he psyched to get it and that you

might actually have a conversation about

gardening basil whatever you like but

then he came back to Instagram and then

he actually probably checked out some

more things and then maybe he saw an

amazing you know soccer highlight and

then he sent that to me and that's the

flywheel um where yes you are

discovering something it's consumption

it's somewhat passive to see a video but

then you send it to a friend you start a

conversation then that helps them

discover more things themselves and they

send it to someone else and that starts

another conversation and that's why

short video for us is so

symbiotic with connecting people with

their friends whereas in you know the

world you come from of long form video

is much less so because if you spend 20

minutes watching or 50 minutes watching

a pod video you probably consuming a lot

less content from Friends sending a lot

less things to friends it's a cool

amazing experience so is going to the

movies and watching a two and a half

hour film um but it is less connected to

and less symbiotic with part of our

reason to be which is to connect people

with friends it's also a huge ask to

send someone like a hourong video right

like that's a crazy ask to to message

someone that but to send someone like a

15-second reel on Instagram totally it's

an easy ask but you also see a lot more

15-second videos in 10 minutes then will

watch long videos so is that the most

important factor then when it comes to

reach shares per Impressions on on

average on average yeah and is that a

stat that like you give to us yeah you

can look at shares and you can look at

reach and then you divide those to we

should make it and I have had this

conversation many times with the team

it's amazing how little influence I feel

like I have on a day-to-day basis that

we should um make more prominent in our

insights tools what matters most so that

we can help people focus on that more

yeah I think you need to dictate that to

us as creators because I think that's

something that YouTube does really well

yeah our YouTube studio app tells us

what matters yes and then we all

optimize for those things tot and we

understand it it's like clickthrough

rate and average view duration and if

we're optimizing for those and driving

high percentage retention then the video

does well couldn't agree more I did a

video recently where I talked about

sends per reach U but I only reached so

many people so we got to get into the

insights because a lot more people yeah

use the insights so what else is

important there in that ranking system

if we have sends per Impressions

essentially when you go down the list I

mean it it'll depend right so likes

matter for sure but I think that those

things can be misleading sometimes

because most people will do one or the

other they'll like or they'll send it's

rare that I'll find something send it

and then also like it and it's not that

I wouldn't have liked it it's I got

distracted by the send I think that

liking is so interesting because it's

like sometimes you don't want to

publicly like commit your name name to

something like I don't want to attach my

name to this video but I think it's

funny uh and sometimes I'll do neither

of those things I won't like it or send

it so does does like watch time matter

or length of time I spend on a on a reel

yeah they definitely matter they matter

a lot less than sense but they matter I

think another thing that's important to

take a look at though is less isn't a

direct engagement rate is what

percentage of your reach was unconnected

versus connected because those are

really two parallel systems that mean so

what percentage of your reach came from

accounts that followed you versus what

percentage of your reach came from

accounts that don't follow you we just

showed your content to them so your your

connected reach should be much more

people are going to on me in the

comments here but it should be more

stable than your unconnected reach right

we try not to get between people and

content from accounts that they follow

so there's you know we don't do

demotions minus one or two exceptions

like misinformation and we basically if

we think you're interested in it we show

it to you but when it comes to

unconnected reach showing you something

in explore or in the reals tab as you're

going through content from accounts you

do not follow there there's a lot of

opportunity and there's a lot of

responsibility

on the opportunity side we should be

able to help you discover things you

didn't even know you loved I mean the

whole promise of the internet is that we

should be celebrating Niche interests I

actually heard you on one of your pods

recently talking about on the crater

business side focusing more on Niche but

we shouldn't all listen to the same top

40 songs we should all be able to

discover oh turns out I'm really into

afro beats or something and you're

really into some specific form of reg I

don't know um the internet should help

us do that and so what I think with

recommendations is that should help with

Niche interests and helping small

creaters grow because it should help

people discover accounts that normally

wouldn't get discovered uh and also

there's way more unconnected content

than there's connected content so you

maybe follow I don't know a few hundred

accounts you know maybe few thousand

accounts most of them don't post

something to feed in a given day yeah

right so you know let's say there's a

100 or 200 things you could see in a

given

day there's over

there's hundreds of millions of pieces

of content posted today that are from

accounts you do not follow a few of

those might be really exciting for you

and and is it like if I'm a Creator and

I'm thinking about how my videos surface

on Instagram one is obviously in the

connected feed people who follow me

absolutely the other is going to be on

explore yes and then the other if I'm

making reals is in the essentially theab

in the reals tab yeah right and so in

those three places um

what are are all those factors that we

just talked about sends per reach uh

length essentially average view duration

on a video uh engagement like do those

factors rank equally across those three

Discovery platforms no not quite the

same so in feed we try to heavily

preference content from accounts that

you follow and accounts where you've got

Mutual follows so if you and I follow

each other we're probably friends in

real life so that content will got it

that content we will value more um in a

number of ways one of is like we just

shift more of the weight and the value

model towards things that friends would

do with each other's content like liking

um whereas that matters Less in the

context or something like that might

matter Less in or commenting which would

matter Less in an unconnected content

where if you're commenting on a public

real you know it's just different it's a

different place um that probably matters

Less in unconnected surfaces like

explore or reals uh but in General sends

matters the most I think across the

board and we're trying to share as much

as we can like for a while they were

very different system so maybe your

explore was all about men's fashion and

your real tab was all about gardening

and that doesn't make any sense so we're

trying to make sure we consolidate the

infrastructure this is a bit more

technical so maybe less interesting so

that as so the app behaves more like you

would expect if you are really

interested in something that you would

see it in any recommendation surface I

think it's technical but as professional

creators it matters a lot to us totally

right because the first thing we think

about is how does our content surface in

this environment and then we will make

adjustments accordingly right absolutely

how important are follower counts

because I think a a common sort of

frustration amongst some creators is

okay I've put in this work over a period

of time to gain a level of followers

right and I don't feel like I'm actually

seeing the benefits of that yes right

I'm not feeling the rise from that I'm

not reaching them yeah so how what

advice do you have for those types of

creators and how do followers play into

reach follow account is super important

because you're GNA have a much better

chance of reaching anybody who follows

you than anybody who doesn't follow you

so there's a really strong correlation

between how many followers you have and

how many people you reach that said they

matter less today in a world where there

is more time spent looking at

recommendations than before than they

mattered you know five years ago now you

might say stop leaning into

recommendations like just focus on

followers bring back old Instagram the

issue with that is that the pie is

smaller recommendations are driving more

overall engagement yes that's good for

us as a business uh we're connecting PE

consumers with more content they're

interested in so that's good for

consumers but there's more reach to go

around so it actually does lift average

reach for all creators um but it doesn't

mean that your reach is more volatile

because a larger percentage of your

average reach will be through the

recommendation system like I was looking

at some of your reals plays counts this

morning and there's you know you've got

some that went nuts and some that are

relatively small and some of them went

nuts maybe because they're paid

Partnerships and people paid for it but

some of them were just totally organic

uh I mean just candidly the ray band

meta one was fully organic which like 60

million views this is insane I haven't

gotten anything that's like 30X anything

I've ever done or maybe 10 but um which

is awesome the thing we noticed though

when what any of our reels that you know

hit the the I would say three 4 million

plus Mark which is only a few but the

ones that have it's relatively immediate

that they got they start getting shared

yeah it's it's like within the first

hour if we are getting if there people

are sharing them in their stories at a

high velocity then yeah that's what

we're and that's a sneaky thing that I

think a lot of people don't realize is a

lot of unconnected reach can come not in

the surfaces we've talked about like

explore or the reals tab but they can

show up in stories or they can show up

in in DMS if you share a real into a

story or you share a real as a DM and

someone watches that then you've got

another impression of play and so

sometimes it can come that way too A lot

of those reals are about uh generative

AI or about the rayan meta about like

future Tech and I think

that you know plays to multiple human

emotions one is like excitement you know

there's like the excitement for the

future isn't this crazy I got to share

it with a friend the other is fear right

like this is terrifying so I have to

share it with a friend yeah um and I

think when you tap

into understanding like triggering an

emotional reaction from someone um and

ideally that emotional reaction is the

desire to connect with someone else um

that's where we've seen the the highest

velocity ofip and this is I'll go into

sort of more my personal intuition as

opposed to based on research but we

don't support feed to feed reshares and

even feed to stoies reshares can only

happen once you can't reshare it again

got it so almost all of what we would

call reshares are

DMS and I think that this is again my

hypothesis this is I don't have rigorous

research to back this up that what you

want to share with one friend or with

the group chat is tends to bias if you

if you biased towards that type of

content tends to be healthier than

something that you want the whole world

to know about um and it's not that you

know we have reposts on threads you know

obviously Facebook has reshares Twitter

has their own version everybody's got

this it's not that things are bad but I

do think they bias more towards like the

whole world needs to know about this

horrible thing that happened or this

Injustice or it's a little bit less

personal it's a little bit less Niche I

most of the reals I sent I would never

post to all my followers I've got a

buddy in London CA we' send each other

ex almost exclusively soccer highlights

from like 45-year-old dads making a shot

on a Sunday leag that they'll never make

again hyper very n the whole world

sounds like it was made just for you

awesome yeah exactly uh whereas you know

with my brother it's like pretty off

color dark standup comedy you know never

would post that to all my followers you

know so with my sister it's more

Furniture Design and architecture so

it's more Niche oriented and I think

it's a little bit less Sensational on

average and I think that helps shift the

tenor of the content that you experience

on Instagram and I'm not saying all the

content people see on Instagram as

positive that is not true any major

social network with hundreds of millions

or billions of users it's going to have

all sorts of negative energy in it but I

think the average energy the average

tenor of the content buys is more

positive on Instagram for a few reasons

and one of them is the content that

rises to the top is the content you

would share with an individual in a

conversation not that you would yell

from a rooftop to the whole world that's

really interesting like that what would

you say is the competitive advantage of

Instagram and real specifically when we

look at like the world of short form

video I look at it as Instagram reals

and Tik Tok and it's not that creators

can't post similar types of videos on

both or the same video on both but what

would you say is you or is Instagram's

sort of superpower when it comes to

Reals in relation to Tik Tok I think

it's more creative freedom obviously Tik

Tok has been leaning into photos and

trying to get into other formats like

stories but they've had a lot less

success there I'm not speaking poorly of

Tik Tok they are phenomenal compe they

do a number of things really well and

there's a few things where I still feel

like we're trying to catch up with them

but in general I think our suite of

tools which by the way sometimes can be

a little intimidating or people get

stressed by how many options there are I

do think gives Critter more freedom to

figure out how they want to realize

their goals and I think that's important

we're also a larger platform worldwide

and so that gives you more potential

reach particularly if your content isn't

uh is Glo is globally applicable which

is hard in video I've actually seen you

guys talk about this too where you know

language is a challenge right if your if

your content requires deep understanding

of what's being said that's tough if

someone doesn't speak the language um so

there's a few things like that um but I

think Tik tok's great I think they do

really great work and they've inspired

us to get a lot better at what we call

exploration based ranking so doing

better ranking for smaller creators and

helping them a chance of breaking out

and just be really really reliably

entertaining like it's like you know

you're going to have a pretty good time

if you open up that out yeah it almost

scares me how good of a time it is yeah

it it it's like uh I'm curious like in

comparison and and maybe this

is if you know the specifics or not but

like how long would it take me on

Instagram to change my for you feed

versus Tik Tok

that on Tik Tok F it's way faster if I

start watching cooking videos the next

time I open Tik Tok I'm in the cooking

world right we're still behind them on

speed there you have to be careful

though cuz sometimes you can be the

opposite problem like explore is still a

little Tippy it's like hey I watch one

cooking video like ease up I don't need

this to be all cooking all the time um

that's not just about speed though

that's about intensity so you might

adapt quickly but not go overboard and

how much cooking in that example you use

they're fa they're very fast um and we

they're very fast in two ways one

understanding your interests more

quickly and adapting and two getting

content that is going to be succeed to

succeed really quickly and that helps

them be culturally relevant we've been

closing the Gap um pretty quickly on

both of those fronts but there's still

room to improve on those areas for us

and then on the the note of language

like we we talk about this all the time

that if you want to a successful short

form piece of content it ideally should

be able to be viewed with the sound off

yes not even any language transcend

language totally I was curious if you

know how many people watch Instagram

with their sound off is that a stat that

you know H I don't have the I don't have

a stat to share but last I checked it's

not about people it's about time so like

what percentage of video Impressions

have sound on or off

um and I think it was like it was

roughly half half it was roughly half I

mean give or take 10% plus or minus but

it was roughly half I think that's a

really important thing for creators to

think about yeah that's why captions are

so important that's why you got to make

sure your captions are visible in the

feed not just in the full screen viewer

one of the classic mistakes is put your

captions and you don't even see them

until you expand the video and then by

then you you probably have S on anyway

but ideally you're like similar to

YouTube where we think a lot about title

thumbnail and packaging the packaging of

a short form piece of content is the

first frame yes and the visual hook

right and so the the first frame and the

visual hook should be able to beod

without language that I think is like

the most important piece of advice I

totally agree but there's also ways to

do it in the in the full video that

aren't necessarily like not using

language like I remember

reading um oh man what was his name

Malcolm gladwell's book I think on

strangers and like not not being able to

trust strangers and there's a whole

section in there I forget why it's even

connected to that idea about the show

Friends and how tons of people around

the world have learned to speak English

watching friends cuz you can basically

know exactly what's happening without

understanding any of the words cuz the

acting is so over the top expressive

inter I'm not trying to offend any

friends lovers out there I know a couple

people life are like passionate about

friends friends is great but you can

kind of know what's going on because

it's almost like a caricature of a

response um and you can think about that

in the content right so I'm not saying

you have to make giant facial

expressions but just watch your video

and see if someone can get the

without actually understanding every

word and as you'll know and if they can

it's going to have a wider appeal so w

with Instagram being so uh DM focused

what I've also noticed is like my

younger cousins use snap a lot for

messaging which is amazing I I like it's

incredible the um how prominent it is as

a messaging app with young people it's

very strong with young people and I I

was curious just we we talked about Tik

Tok I think about snap and I think about

just how young people are using the

internet today versus when you know this

was the earlier version of social it

felt like the battle was for the user

base is that correct like like trying to

get as many users as possible like what

is

the what what is the the war you're

fighting or the battle you're fighting

today with the other competitors like

what is the competition

for it's for a number of different

things I mean it is at some level for

attention right we are an advertising

based business and that business is

going to be proportional to the amount

of attention that's spent on the

platform got it but it's also for

cultural relevance I I think a lot about

what decisions do we need to make that

don't necessarily grow the pie but I

think will be good for the business over

the long term so I mean one thing that

is controversial is we focus on creators

and we don't focus on Publishers we

don't try to prevent Publishers from

using our platform but we build features

for creators we don't build features for

Publishers I don't have teams that goal

on P any any production that includes

Publishers if I can avoid it I have

team's goal on Creator production can

you define the difference yeah so a

Creator is an individual that creates

original content with some level of

commercial intent that's a I don't mean

necessarily making money it could just

be like sure part of what you do you're

trying to grow because you're trying to

achieve something on the platform um so

Publishers are you know brands

magazines newspapers doesn't have to

just be news um and there's there's

amazing content from Publishers on the

platform but they're not individuals um

they are creating original content and

they definitely have commercial intent

and we focus on creators because we

believe con power is going to continue

to shift from institutions to

individuals across Industries we've seen

this in sports we've seen this in news

we've seen this in music we've seen this

in every vertical but just think about

how

relevant as athletes are right now

relative to the play relative to the

teams that they play for sure and how

different that was 20 30 years ago with

very few exceptions a lot of people's

Allegiance is sometimes primarily to a

player now not to a team that's insane

if you think about sports fans when I

was a kid and so we just think that that

is that shift is going to continue and

we also see that in the data creaters

drive on average more engagement than

publisher does people want to see the

world through the eyes of another

individ idual that they relate to or

that they look up to more than they want

to consume content from a publisher that

they feel is hyper processed and

produced and um designed for them if if

that Trend keeps up uh what does

Instagram have to do to continue to make

creators happy I think a lot about when

uh Kylie Jenner shared that post of

Instagram Instagram again and that was

in relationship to like some pretty good

memes about me that was fun but like if

you know LeBron has more followers than

the Lakers right like if that Trend

continues for creators yes what does

Instagram have to do to keep creators

happy in the next five 10 years creators

are tough to keep happy um but there's a

number of different things that we know

that they care about and we work hard

contrary to popular belief I'm trying to

keep them happy um one is clearly you

know is reach and it's not I do think

reach is a means to an end it's not an

end and of itself and I think too many

people just focus on reach for reach's

sake but you want reach should be

growing over time and ideally relatively

stable that's very hard to deliver on

any platform that guarantees you stable

reach is lying uh that doesn't mean that

platforms aren't working on it and

trying to give you more reach and trying

to figure out how to grow the pie but

pure stability is really it's not

possible even if everyone just did

chronological feeds everywhere but that

matters a lot um I it also Matters How

safe you feel on the platform do you

feel like you can be yourself um or the

part can you share the part of stuff

that you want to share um so that's

about protection it's about dealing with

you know any antagonistic behaviors or

bullying or harassment but safety

matters a lot um Revenue matters a lot

but actually to a very small subset of

creators the vast majority of creators

are very small and they're too small to

monetize in a meaningful way and so yes

they care about monetization they want

to hear about monetization but it's

actually not the thing that they can or

should really focus on because if you

have 2,000 followers it's not really

going to be the thing that you spend

your time on is figuring out how to grow

your following not try to make money

from 2,000 followers um they also care a

lot about being able to connect with and

interact with both the their fans but

also other creators so we try to also

figure out ways to facilitate

connections between creators and

creators and fans actually that's

another thing that we do really

particularly well that we kind of loed

into is with DMS if I just I'm a fan of

you and I follow you and then you figure

who I am and then you you can text me on

Instagram and it goes into my inbox so I

know people in Hollywood who just like

end up making real connections with

people who become lifelong business

partners because they like their stuff

on Instagram and it's not even they're

not even digital n of creators it's like

a film scorer or a director um so those

are the things we try to improve and um

obviously um we've got room to improve

across the board as ases everybody I

think it's interesting to hear that uh

revenue is not as important and sure for

for a Creator who maybe has 2,000

followers it's like not something that's

coming their way when we told our

friends that we were coming here who are

primarily YouTube creators that we were

going to be sitting down with you they

were so interested in Revenue I think

for us like we come from this culture of

Revenue share yeah and I know Facebook

does it and I'm curious like where does

Instagram lie yeah Revenue share I'll

talk about Revenue share in a second but

you should also tell me if I'm wrong

that's just the research that we have

suggests what what creators care about I

think for me the the challenge is that I

don't think we can

blanket use the term creators anymore

and I and I think specifically on

Instagram I think it's harder to use

that term I think the term is so broad

that it's challenging to have it

encapsulate everyone in the category

right and and when it comes to Instagram

like you know my parents are on

Instagram they post content on Instagram

and they probably have a thousand or

2000 that we have so many cousins Indian

family so it's like we have so many

cousins we probably have 2,000 followers

on YouTube there's more a divide between

like Creator and consumer line is

Instagram it's way more it's just like

everyone everyone can be considered a

Creator and so there for me if we look

at it as like a a pyramid of like the

emerging Creator you know as the base of

the pyramid the vast majority on

Instagram is going to be an emerging or

aspiring Creator someone who knows how

to make good stuff but they haven't

figured out how it can become their

their full-time income then you have

like the professional Creator group

who's making a living right and then you

have the top tier which is probably like

uh A-list celebrity and and hyper large

scale creators at the top of that if if

we're talking about the Creator pyramid

there and the base is not gonna care

about revenue or maybe they care about

it but it's not going to be a factor for

them yet yes but the next Notch and up

care a ton care car to

to I think there's a bit of for me on

Instagram that I've accepted the fact

that the way we monetize is we build an

audience and then we it's a part of our

broader advertising business it's not

something we split with the platform

yeah but we're able to sell you know

native advertising

ourselves Instagram yeah which makes a

ton of sense that's actually last I best

we can tell well north of A5 billion

industry is people doing brand deals off

platform on in and then Distributing

that content on Instagram so and I do I

do totally understand the revenue

matters a ton particularly for large

creators and large creators are

disproportionately important right

because they reach more people um on rev

share because I I want to make sure I'm

not St in the question it's something

that we're working on it's something

that I think is just fundamentally more

difficult with short form video though I

do think shorts is doing decently um but

with long form video Everything is a bit

more straightforward um particularly

attribution so if you watch a 20-minute

video and you see three ads you know

what percentage you want to share and

it's very clear who those who that share

goes to um whereas with short firm video

if you watch 50 videos and you see 15

ads

who gets those dollars um so attribution

is tricky in and of itself but the

bigger problem is that we haven't

figured out a way to do it that isn't

just burning cash um so we are running

tests for what we call bonuses which are

essentially performance-based incentives

so you know we will pay you to create

more content and then people create more

content but then we measure does that

actually increase the revenue for the

app and so that we can actually have

money to share back and we are finding

that it is much easier to make those

programs Roi positive for photos than

for videos and one of the reasons is

photos are higher monetization

efficiency because you you get more add

Impressions because you look at photos

for less time but another is that per

dollar when you pay a Creator to create

something new they will create more

incremental photos and incremental

videos because videos are harder to make

and really interesting

the incremental content they make is

lower quality than the average quality

but that drop is much lower for photos

than for reals so they'll make another

reel but they will only make one and

it's way worse than the Reel that they

would have created otherwise um or the

first reel that they would have created

either way and so we are trying to

figure out okay what can we do about

that how can we get this working because

to me I need that program to make enough

money so that we can pay

creators and have those checks be

credible if I send you guys a $112 check

it's probably going to make you think

worse of us than if we just didn't have

a program and so we're iterating and

we're iterating in Japan and Korea and

the us to try to get these programs on

their video side working so that we can

then scale them up but for us to do that

it's going to need to be it's going to

need to not burn money it's going to

need to be uh get to a place where the

eligibility can be I hope ideally uh

public so you know why you're allowed to

be in the program in the first place and

the checks need to be credible um which

probably comes down to cpms at the end

of the day yeah I think credibility is

the most important because I don't think

you know if we got a $12 check I don't

think I would be I would feel

disrespected or anything like that I

would just want to know how did that

happen yeah but it might discourage oh

it might discourage but if I knew if I

knew there was a clear path towards like

hey this is why it was $12 based off the

viewership you got here's what you can

do to increase it right I may feel

better about the trick though is it's

not just about your viewership it's

about the replacement value so let's say

you made you made 10 re through the

program and they all got really good

views but if you hadn't made it we would

have had just as much engagement from

him that was in paid for then from an

Instagram business perspective the the

ROI is negative 100% so if we paid you a

th000 bucks making up numbers now for 10

re and the replacement value was Z you

would look at it your reals and be like

they all got 500,000 views and these are

the cpms you owe me X and it's like yes

but from a business perspective if we

hadn't paid you

$1,000 and we would have had we would

have made the exact same amount of

Revenue then then we've actually just

burned $1,000 and so it's yes we should

we should show you why um but My worry

is that let's say I show you why to the

degree I can and let's say I even pay

you more more than 100% M let's say it's

$1,000 and I pay I pay you $1,000 and we

and we only and we only made an

incremental

$900 you know I've lost $900 and you've

got a $100 check and you probably are

going to think that I'm being cheap

because I'm only paying you a 100 bucks

for 10 videos that got half a million

views each so It's Tricky and I'm not

trying to say our job is hard of course

our job is hard and we've got great jobs

and I'm very grateful for them yeah I'm

just saying that the program has to be

sustainable because if it's not if we're

burning cash when things get tight when

the economy goes up and down and AD

dollars go up and down and a lot of our

business is just exposed to

macroeconomics at this point then when

we cut marketing budgets like one of the

things that we're going to cut is a

program that is literally burning money

and I need the program to be stable

right I can't have a program this year

and take it away for everyone and take

it away next year and then bring it back

to year after that's just jerking you

around and you all particularly the

large craters you're a business so how

much money you make matters but so does

the consistency of those dollars so that

you can plan accordingly you know I

think we had it's really interesting

actually I I didn't anticipate that

answer from you I think uh what you just

said makes a ton of sense uh and I think

about when we first started we were

making such Niche content on YouTube

that AdSense and revenue share was

nominal for the first n years of us

being on YouTube and so we learned how

to build a business without Revenue

share and so when even when I think

about Instagram

like I I do think that now the culture

and to look out out the next five 10

years like solving some level of Revenue

share for for video is important or some

level of platform monetization but

largely because of what you just talked

about from a macroeconomic standpoint I

think all creators need to solve if

consistency is important the ads

business is actually not the best

business to be consist it's inherently

volatile it's inherently volatile so

then if you're building a a a business

on top of you know Instagram then

platform monetization would not be the

path for your most consistent check I

think we want to feel valued because we

feel valued by other platforms and I

think

YouTube figuring out the the the shorts

Revenue sharing model in this like large

pool um it feels like a nice step in

that direction I was curious what you

thought about that of like the the model

that they've implemented there I think

it's a I think it's a good model I don't

know if it's working or not sure from a

business perspective because I don't

know maybe they're just subsidizing

their shorts business with their long

form video business or with their search

business because they want to grow in

short form video because I mean Tik Tok

hurt us in 2020 2021 but it hurt them

way more so it's not unre unreasonable

as a business to take a loss in order to

grow market share um and assume that

you're going to figure it out later

which they might be doing um and to be

clear like they are best in class at rev

share but rev share is not the only way

to make money as a Creator whereas Tik

Tok is best in class at discovering

small craters and helping them pop but

it's not Best in Class at rep share it's

not Best in Class in stability of reach

in fact that ability to pop is sort of

inversely correlated with stability of

reach because it's more volatile by

definition and so I think they're doing

I think they're doing good work I think

I know a lot of people who work there

who just do good stuff I don't know if

they're subsidizing it or if they're

just better at it than we are or what or

what's going on but also YouTube

isn't Google or alphabet's main business

search is their main business and

whenever you are in an adjacent business

like I'm sure they care about their p&l

and I think you guys interviewed Neil

before but it's not the same pressure uh

like whereas Instagram yes Facebook and

Instagram

our like sister apps like we're both

driving most of the revenue for the

company in order to subsidize all the

other longer term bets that we're making

so one thing is Facebook video we have

friends who their number one yeah

Revenue Source people underappreciate it

is Facebook instream ads yeah it's huge

it's a huge source of Revenue and a lot

of that is because they're posting you

know relatively longer form content 3 to

six maybe 10 minute videos on Facebook

and the content's engaging and I'm

surprised always when we meet a Creator

who's like yeah I make most of my money

from Facebook Facebook is much bigger

than Instagram worldwide if you just

look at Raw minutes per day or raw hours

per day I do think though it's a

different app in a number of ways they

don't have DMS in it um we have a much

stronger position and a lot more on in a

lot of countries not all countries

around friends sharing products like

stories not just DMS and I just think I

think of like connecting friends is an

adjacent thing to Short from video and

short from video is an adjacent thing to

Long Fromm video but long firm video and

connecting friends aren't adjacent and

it pains me to because I love podcasts

uh watching them listening to them doing

them um I actually did a couple

interviews with creators over the last

couple weeks and it pains me sometimes

that long form content just doesn't have

a real great home on Instagram but if

our core thing is about connecting

people over creativity I can't get

enamored with the longform video

business and then lose our core identity

people think and they give us criticism

and it's fair sometimes that sometimes

we lose our way or forget who we are but

the reason why I am not interested in

pursuing long form video in a meaningful

way is because I don't want to erode our

our it's not even our business like our

cor our heart like our core reason to

exist I do think a a piece of short form

vertical content right now is one of the

highest margin branded content pieces in

a Creator business like we've

experienced it right like when we do a

short form vertical video

campaign typically the ad dollars are

there right there's there's more ad

dollars that have shifted towards short

form vertical video now the piece of

content can also be posted across

platform uh different platforms and it's

easier to make than a long form YouTube

video and so in this moment right now

the short form vertical video branded

content business is probably the highest

margin video business for creators that

obviously is dependent on your size and

scale but I think in in large part that

is the highest margin business right now

as a Creator I believe that you did a

video on uh pod recently I forgot what

the name of the Creator was but they

starting to charge and they got a big

backlash they wanted to they they put a

lot of their content

yes and so you were talking

about this sort of space

yeah I think there are things that long

form is better at and I think there are

things that are short form are better at

but from an advertiser's perspective I

think it depends on what the

advertiser's outcome is right so just

think about branded content in general

even in the podcast world right you've

got one extreme which is basically

direct response

advertising ag1 subscriptions where they

take a cut of the subscription and then

you get the other end which is like much

more sort of like almost like you're

playing in like the B2B space like

acquired you know and they're getting

each deal that those guys get is a big

deal for them they spend a lot of time

nurturing those deals they have a few

deals but those deals are pretty solid

and they almost all of those guys who

sign up stick with them um and then

there's a whole range of things in

between so if you're trying to reach a

small Niche audience and have a really

deep stable connection you know I think

acquired long form type stuff whether

it's podcasts or otherwise maybe YouTube

videos is probably better creating a

deeper richer more enduring long-term

connection for sure yeah if you're

trying to do like um you know Dr maybe

it doesn't matter because you just want

to get that that one conversion or maybe

you're trying to do brand awareness and

there there it's really about just

getting a larger type of funnel so it's

not about the niche it's just like you

want to reach as many people as possible

to let them know about toothpaste or

whatever it is that you're selling

something that has really a broad

addressable market and so as a Creator

yes you should think about your costs a

lot and how much does it take and cost

you to make a photo versus a short form

video versus a long form video but as

you think about your Advertiser deals

that you work with and if you are

privileged enough to be able to be picky

you should understand what kind of

business they are and what they're

trying to get out um what they're trying

to get out of advertising and how much

your content or the Deep different types

of content you could create align with

those Advertiser

interests and I think that's a level of

sophistication that's hard if you spend

all of your time just trying to figure

out how to make something that pops uh

which I which I get which I totally get

I think you have to spend have had spent

some time in your life which we did

fortunately sitting in those rooms with

advertisers and understanding and

empathizing with their position yeah and

I think once you can understand that you

can understand how they fit into your

world one of the things that we think

from our side because this is obviously

you know a multi-sided Marketplace so

primarily two-sided and then we're a

platform is in the world of branded

content if that's the primary way that

creators make money on Instagram one of

the interesting things it's just there's

no measurement there's like so little

measurement people don't advertisers

don't necessarily know what they're

going to get yes you can be like go to

momentus

elements.com Adam and like hopefully we

can like do the attribution that way but

for the most part there's very little

measurement um in that world my take is

that larger names tend to get overpaid

and smaller names get underpaid because

the advertisers advertisers spend more

based on intuition because they don't

have numbers to go off of that's a

distortion in the market that scares me

because I feel like any Distortion will

inevitably get corrected at some point

and we'll probably get blamed for it and

so I want to figure out how we can help

that the whole industry move forward

that's one of the reasons why I like

partner ads so much is not because

they're a potential Revenue stream for

us though they are but because they

allow branded content to have proper

measurement and if we do that if more of

this industry or more of the Branded

content ecosystem is measured my

hypothesis is that you will see dollars

shift from the largest creators to more

Niche creators you might sell more of

whatever you're trying to sell by

reaching 100 small creators than running

one big check for the same amount of

Total Money to one big Creator but right

now you would never do that because it's

impossible to manage can we help that

through measurement through connections

through the Creator Marketplace is I

think something that we're still trying

to crack could you explain partner ads

Yeah so basically way a partner ad works

is you do what you would normally do so

you would like who's one of your oh we

we talked about Canon before so let's

say Canon was like we want you to make

some content uh we want to do some ads

for you uh with with you for our cameras

you would make the creative and then you

would make it so that they could use

your creative as an ad to people who

don't even follow you yep and it just

basically allows you to own the creative

the content is attributed to your

account but it can get distributed

through our ad system and so it gets all

of the measurement of our ad system and

all that infrastructure um which helps

advertisers understand demand understand

demographics understand

conversions um because the bread and

butter of our advertising business is

not brand advertising though that's a

good amount of money it's direct

response advertising where measurement

is everything uh and then Canon will

know all right I wrote These Guys a

check like what did I get for it and

like that could be scary yeah yeah or

that could be amazing because if you are

if if if they realize that they paid you

I'm making up random numbers now

$110,000 but they made

35 you know that's then you're worth

more than you're getting paid got to

increase our rate yeah but then but you

would never know unless we do this so I

love I I actually love that about

Instagram because it makes the

advertising more native to the platform

right like the advertising is Creator

oftentimes it's creators in sponsored

post which is great because then it's

like native advertising to the platform

I actually think that's where YouTube is

behind right now and I don't think it's

the platform's fault I actually think

it's the probably the industry at the

moment where they're running TV spots on

YouTube where if you were running ads on

YouTube with YouTube creators in the

pre-roll that felt more native I

actually think there'd be more effective

ads yeah um and I think those are those

are really effective on Instagram I do

think the more measurable advertising

gets the less it values General kind of

brand lift and association with creators

that's true but I think that's mostly

true because brand lift is harder to

measure it's it's you can't measure it

really but there's like a I guess you

can through like surveys and you just

need a lot of scale to be able to do it

without the air bars being so Bonkers

that it's not even worth doing yeah um

but to be clear I mean there's a lot of

AD dollars right now on brand marketing

with very little measurement I mean just

think about how TV works yeah uh I mean

there's measurement it's not no

measurement but it's not have you ever

met someone who's a neelon house no no I

have not never met I've never gotten

that phone call I've never gotten the

call I'd think I'd be a great neelon man

would

terrible actually have one question on

paid partnership when when we click like

paid partnership or branded content but

that the advertiser doesn't boost the

content use it as sponsorship does

anything happen in the ranking system to

our content nothing no no we don't I

mean it would be really problematic if

that decreased your reach because then

we'd have people avoiding marking things

as paid and by the way in some countries

it's law like you can get in real

trouble in Germany for instance for

getting paid and not marking something

as paid so much so that a lot of people

in Germany creators Mark things that as

paid that aren't paid worried that

there's like there might be some maybe

they got a gift like a year ago and it's

gonna get they're gonna get in trouble

they do hashtag ad on all this yeah yeah

yeah I'm curious you mentioned smaller

creators what are some sort of metrics

or talking points that smaller creators

could use to convince advertisers and

maybe it's you know agencies who are

using this information but how does that

smaller Creator get that deal I think

it's probably about being more clear

about

who your audience is and why that

audience is disproportionately valuable

to that Advertiser so you know let's use

I don't I don't love the example of

supplements because there's so many

Shady actors in that world but it's an

easier example like if you only have a

few thousand followers but they're

really passionate and they're all about

like biohacking and health stuff then

like they are way more valuable to a

thorn supplement um Advertiser than the

average person and so you shouldn't just

care as The Advertiser about the number

you should care about how much How

likely in this case this hypothetical

example those followers are to want to

buy your product um so it's about

understanding your Niche and why that

Niche is disproportionately valuable to

that Advertiser is probably the most

straightforward way do you do you care

if a Creator is considered an Instagram

Creator in the same way that I think you

know YouTube creators just have a brand

to them right that's a YouTube Creator

or a Tik to or a Tik tocker like you

guys are YouTubers yeah we're YouTubers

right like I know I wanted to say it a

lot at some point but like do you care

about like creators being considered

Instagram creators I care about our

cultural relevance and both to the

general population and to creators I

think that I don't think that we should

ever do anything to discourage YouTubers

or Tik tokers who are primarily on those

platforms from being successful that

would be

literally just bad for our business um

but I do care that there is a critical

mass of crators that have an affinity

for and a loyalty to our platform which

is one of the reasons why I care so much

about small creators in general I think

it's way more practical to help a new

generation of creators grow on your

platform and therefore have some more

affinity and loyalty to your platform

than it is to pull someone who's had 15

years of success on YouTube and get them

to switch their primary that's just

swimming Upstream

um that's another reason why I think

small crators are super important and

why we' trying to do more and more to

benefit

them um but I think if we are only a

secondary platform for most crators

that's probably a bad place to be in

best case we can best we can tell we are

a larger we're the largest platform for

creators so there's the most creators

active on our platform but obviously

we've talked about a couple things where

other platforms are better um but I do

but the sentiment is not quite as high

um so

people well probably hearing this as a

crater and if you're upset about your

reach you're probably going to think the

sentiment is really bad that is true

there is definitely a group of people

who are really upset about reach uh it

doesn't come it isn't like the over

doesn't overwhelm sentiment for the

entire population um it's in some sense

a very loud and I'm not trying to throw

any shade here but a very loud minority

that we're trying to figure out how to

address and we need to do better by but

actually the average sentiment around

Instagram for the average Creator is

quite high but it's not quite as high in

certain countries as some of the

competition and I I'd like to close that

Gap yeah I feel like um I'm curious like

how do you get that next crop of

creators excited about Instagram I think

they have to have find you have to they

have to find success on the platform

yeah but they also have to maintain that

success so more small creators will find

some success on Tik Tok than any other

platform but often it's like a flash in

the pan and then it goes away and that's

not really helpful because you haven't

built anything sustainable um whereas on

Instagram and on YouTube it's harder to

break in I think we aren't as good at

valuing small smaller creators it's

harder from a technical reason you've

got less data but uh so it's a little

bit harder to break in so we're trying

to find the right balance make it

possible for new talent to break out and

and grow

while not losing so much

not getting not not having reach become

so volatile that your follower account

doesn't matter and people say it doesn't

matter on Instagram but it really

matters in a way that it doesn't matter

nearly as much on some of the other apps

I think that's a challenge that creators

have with short form content no matter

where it is is building brand right if

you're making long form content it is

difficult but if someone chooses to

spend 20 minutes with you they will

remember you tomorrow there are times

when with short form content because you

can consume so much in such a short

amount of time that you may not actually

remember the Creator you just saw even

if you loved what you just saw right it

feels like it served the purpose of

entertainment for you like that lean

back experience I don't know if I agree

so yes if you were going to compare

someone who watched one 15-second video

end to end and one 15 video 15minute

video sorry 15 minute video end to end

so clearly you're going to have more

memory more affiliation with the with

the um 15 minute video I don't know that

means that on average the average sord

creator has a harder time building a

brand because the average short fir

Video Creator can make many more videos

for the in the same amount of time for

the same amount of

money um so you might mean you get more

at bats I think it's what makes it

harder to stand out on the first for as

first impression are surrounded yeah

yeah I will say though like I I think

about and Colin and I talk about this

like every platform needs model citizens

right because the younger crop that

comes in they need to see what success

looks like totally YouTube is you know

with YouTube we have the Mr Beast the

Ryan Tran the Michelle car and right now

when I think about Instagram and I think

about a short form Creator who has stood

out quite a bit I think about Haley yeah

uh Haley Bailey she produces so much

content unbelievable the amount of

content on every platform out of this

world she's not like exclusive To Us by

any searches imag yeah that is an

incredible feat truly but to put out

that much I think she is extremely

recognizable and what Colin's mentioning

of like building a brand on the platform

she's built an Inc I think about Keith

Lee as well who really long F reviews

you love these niches which is amazing

uh and I do think that there are some

you know what I would consider model

citizens emerging they're not

necessarily exclusive to the platform or

uh but I'm curious if you have that

feeling if you have that sense of like

that's something that Instagram needs to

inspire the younger crop I think we need

that I think you need models to have

other or success stories for the newer

creators to look up to we do see that

more creators have us as our primary PL

as our primary platform than any other

platform and all the off platform

surveys we do so you're more likely if

you're a Creator to say um Instagram is

my primary than any other platform but

also at the same time every time we

measure the number of creators that use

multiple platforms goes up because the

Creator Community is getting more Savvy

you don't want to have all of your risk

in one basket um so I do think that that

is a hard position to maintain long term

but it is a um there is a certain amount

of cache and cultural relevance that

comes with Instagram that we have to

fight to maintain um because I think

that's also can easily um fall so it

does matter it does matter that you have

success stories to prove that it can you

can realize your aspirations on the

platform because if you can't see

anybody that you can relate to who

succeeded on the platform you're not

going to believe that you can

the some of the early success stories on

Instagram from when I remember us

building our career were a lot of the

like meme accounts or the aggregator

accounts yeah and I know you recently

made an announcement around originality

and a commitment to originality I was

wondering if you could explain that

controversial G to get a lot of heat

from the aggregators coming up so I do

want to separate memes and um

aggregators sure because you can be an

original Meme creator there a lot of

great meme creators out

there so the idea behind originality is

that we should make sure that more value

if we can flows to the original creators

that make something than those who find

that content and then um repackage it

and aggregate it from other original

content creators and that if we don't do

that we will just erode more and more

trust with the original content creator

Community which will be bad for us over

the long run it'll manifest as negative

sentiment people leaving the platform

maybe they stay on the platform but

they're quick to um criticize us nobody

defends us and I think reputation

matters um even though it might actually

not be beneficial it might be beneficial

but it might not probably won't be

beneficial to the business in the short

run so this is a classic challenge in

running a business of short-term

long-term trade-offs are you willing to

eat a long a short-term hit because you

think you're going to be in a better

place longterm even if you might not

ever be able to measure it because what

you're in this case you're doing is

you're reducing the risk of a negative

outcome and so if it doesn't happen you

never knew that it would have um so what

we work on is meas defining originality

and there's different buckets there's

original there's mixed original so if I

take your video and then I like do a

green screen on top and I talk about it

that's mixed original and then there's

unoriginal or and mixed unoriginal so I

just like take someone else's and i'

post it can we get good at classifying

that content and can we um figure out

how to

responsibly privilege the original

content and I don't think we want to

boost I don't like boosts like if you

just boost something it's bad because

it's just tends to be opaque it's a

little bit like no one knows what's

happening behind the curtain and it

doesn't feel very transparent so what

we're trying to do is in some sense

riskier is not recommend content from

aggregators so if you follow an

aggregator because you love the and

there are a lot of amazing aggregators

out there great you'll see their content

in your feed if we think you're

interested in it we're not going to do

anything to get between you and that

content if you're not seeing it it's

because we could be wrong but we think

something else is more interesting to

you that you

follow but if we show you content from

an aggregator from an account you don't

follow then that's much more on us and

so I actually said this before there's

more opportunity and there's more

responsibility um so if we if you see

something Shady from like a friend of

yours that's like on your shady friend

if we show you something Shady from a

random person that's really on us uh so

there's more count there's more risk and

more accountability but there's also

more opportunity I think it is

reasonable for us to say we're not going

to amplify we're not going to recommend

content from aggregators um but we are

going to recommend content from creators

because we are invested in creators over

the next five or 10 years so let's just

say like practical example is a sports

highlight aggregator posts a high school

dunk but the original creator of that

video yes was one of that uh basketball

player's friends who was filming it yes

they filmed it it got reposted on a on a

big Sports account yes so is the

suggestion there that instead of showing

it from the sports account it would show

it from the original post that is one

thing we do okay we call that direct

replace okay so if we can find the

original then we just swap it out um

which is pretty nuts so it's almost as

like a reshare like would it still look

like it's from the aggregator

no I was saying it would be the original

video in your feed again this is in a

recommendation it would be weird if it

was just in the connected context you're

just looking at stuff that we think you

think are going to be interesting in the

reals tab this aggregator found this

amazing dunk if we know if we can find

the original post of that dunk we're

just going to swap it out and show you

the original because in the feed yeah

yeah got it you know and how do you find

that is that like the content ID system

similar to YouTube yeah very similar so

in in our experience with Content ID and

like original

content specifically whether it's

YouTube Instagram Tik Tok most of our

content is cut in a different way than

we would cut it it's it's meaningfully

transformed yeah um so it doesn't get

picked up in a in a Content ID system

right it's a clip of us sitting with Mr

Beast but there's Now new b-roll on top

of it so that's not gonna get picked up

right the most viewed Colin and Samir

videos on the internet are not made by

us yeah yeah right by other people and

for us in in where we are in business

I'm completely fine with that that is

more visibility for us the internet is

better at cutting clips from our videos

than we are there will be clips from

this of you that are cut by other people

right that are just

crowdsourced um you know and I I don't

really have a problem with that I think

that's okay um and I it's it's hard to

find the original Source when and we

can't always find it mostly it will be

transformed in some way shape or form

yes right but that's why we can't just

rely on Direct replace so direct replace

only gets us so far what we look at is

what percentage of recommendations so

what percentage of photos and videos

that you're seeing from accounts you do

not follow are original or unoriginal

and we want we want to grow the

percentage that is original there will

always be recommendations that are

unoriginal because we're never going to

be perfect and that's I want to be clear

I like at our skills it's not possible

doing the direct replace or that swap

only gets you so far um because maybe

the original was posted on YouTube or

was posted on Tik Tok talk we then we

can't know who's is the original um so

what we look at is does this account

tend to post original content or does

this piece of content look like an

original piece of content so you look at

things like how similar is this video to

the last n videos that this account has

posted aggregators tend to have much

more variance my stuff my grid is boring

as hell you just it's just my mug over

and over and over again right so it's

not that hard for a classifier to tell

that my account is Po in original

content uh or that any given video on my

account is probably original if it's me

again um sorry if you follow me um

whereas if it's an aggregator there's a

lot more variance and so it's much more

likely that the classifier will predict

that this thing is UN original and if it

does we're not going to demote it from

anybody who follow to anybody from

anybody who follows you but we're not

going to recommend it proactively to

someone who doesn't follow you and so we

do this at the content and the actor

level and we want to let you know so if

we think you're a Content aggregator we

want to let you know that and we'll put

that in account status so you can see

okay you're non- recommendable not

because you post anything problematic

but because you're an aggregator and

we're not recommending aggregators and

and that way you can do something about

it maybe you need to you need to do more

of your own spin on things add your

b-roll add your commentary add your I

mean look if you take my photo and you

make it into a meme of me with some

really mean mean comment on on the top

that is original yeah wow whether or not

I like it you may have just asked for

that with that video I get it anyway you

should see my DMs it's a thing so

another thing that we're seeing

specifically this week uh is Instagram

tagging and classifying content as made

with AI yes and that is uh you know

something that I noticed a week ago and

I was like huh that's strange I this

photo does not look like it was made

with AI but maybe it's maybe they did

some fill on Photoshop and and posted it

on here there probably something really

light like that is that how that works

like and how does it it's just the

metadata on the on the image so we're

trying to lean on the on industry

standards here so there's going to be

more and more content that is generated

with AI over time and is going to be

more and more difficult to identify it

there is no way we're going to be able

to programmatically identify everything

that is posted on Instagram as that was

that did use AI as having used AI long

term so I want to be clear like the goal

here is wouldn't we know for us to be

transparent so that people can make

educated decisions about what to believe

and not by the way it might have no

relevance because if it's just a funny

video then it's a or funny picture

doesn't really matter if it's made with

AI or not necessarily so we're trying to

lean on industry standards here and so

there is a Adobe has I forget what the

name of the metadata property or

attribute is but they Mark files that

used AI in Photoshop as having used Ai

and then we pick that up and we mark it

and um some of the other apps are doing

the same thing um what's happening is

people are doing benign things in

Photoshop that are technically using AI

it might not even be generative fill it

might be like I don't know maybe their

stamp tool uses AI you know you know

because AI is just a core technology

doesn't mean totally fabricated image

and so it's getting marked because

they're being conservative in what

they're marking in the file and then

we're just respecting the files mark

saying hey AI was used to make this and

then it's possible that the creator

doesn't even know that it was Ai and the

tool that they used so we have to figure

this out because clearly this is

frustrating and not the ideal experience

um and I'm not sure where we're going to

land because it's this isn't just an

Instagram or issue it's an industry

issue and I think if we do our own thing

and everyone does their own thing then

and you don't have an industry standard

I think the whole internet is less well

off um but we have figure rap ing

problem I would say with the election

it's has to be so trusted in the event

that something gets posted without that

made with AI but it is in some way

altered and it just wasn't picked up

then you're in a real situation where

people are believing something but

that's also going to happen like right

now if you make an image you know with a

number of different of these uh

diffusion models and it doesn't Mark and

a lot of them don't mark it in the in

the metadata like we don't have a way to

tell we can build classifiers to trust

try to detect it looking at the typical

types of artifacts you might see but

that is an arms race and we will never

have full coverage I want to be super

clear there will be content on all

platforms that is made by Ai and is not

marked as AI because the platform wasn't

able to detect it because the person who

made it specifically tried to avoid that

and that just means that yes I think we

should do our part to detect what we can

to label what we can but people also

just have to be Discerning readers or

consumers because

this isn't an Instagram thing this is an

internet thing you're going to have to

assume that it's possible that someone

made something um using these

technologies that was by the way

possible before gender of AI it's just

way more possible now yeah it's way

easier now I think what makes it harder

on Instagram is that Instagram is this

wide array of content where I can open

Instagram and see that you know one of

my friends from high school is having a

baby and then I can immediately go into

like geopolitical issues and then

immediately go into watching a creator

that I like and I think the context

switching in my brain of what's truth

and not truth or real and not real is

harder in a platform where I'm

consuming such a wide variety of what's

serious what's entertainment what's

comedy no I agree with that I mean the

cognitive load in a platform where the

content has more variation and not just

substance but like topic and how you

should approach it you know how I should

approach a video of my my brother posts

of his 2-year-old girl is very different

than how I should approach like a news

clip from a uh you know I don't know

about the election or about a war um so

yes I I totally agree those can happen

in a matter of you know seconds they

could be adj they could be adj less than

a second yeah yeah W with that in mind

do you have any thoughts

around you know like I guess the impact

on Mental Health the impact on you know

a young Generation Um and how much they

should or shouldn't be using the

platform I think parents know best for

each kid I'm a I'm a dad I have three

boys but they're to Young use Instagram

they're 86 and4 and I think that

platforms like Instagram can bring an

immense amount of value H to anybody in

including kids or teens I should say but

they can also be problematic um just

like anything can I think that looking

at too many unrealistic images in a

magazine when I was a kid is also can be

problematic but it can also be inspiring

it depends on who I am and also where I

am in that moment maybe the same

magazine or the same platform or

Instagram in this case could be really

great for me today and could be really

problematic for me tonight um based on

where I am emotionally right now so the

thing that we try to do is one make sure

that we focus as much as we can on

addressing parents concerns we get a lot

of scrutiny and a lot of incoming

compliance requirements and we engage a

lot with policy makers and we're going

to do our best to comply with local laws

and make sure we're taking feedback from

policy makers but I care more about what

parents think and what um child experts

think and so we primarily try to P

prioritize our work uh based on those

interests and then to build tools to

empower them right so one of the things

that we have built and that we're

actually doubling down on right now is

tools to help parents shape the

experience into what they think is best

for their kid um so maybe they want to

have blackout periods where I don't want

my kid using Instagram in the E week

weekday evenings because it's homework

time or I want to give my kid an hour

limit um you know how can we help them

shape that experience um without giving

the teen a really strong incentive just

to lie to their parents and to us

because you could always pretend you're

older than you are or have a second

account that you don't tell your parents

about so it's a kind of a a really

difficult balance because if what we

build for parents is to

restrictive teens are Savvy they'll just

work around it so we have to figure out

how to do it in a way that can address

parents needs

without pushing teens so far that

they're just gonna lie I'm curious on

that note the the law that Rona santis

passed in Florida when he passed that I

remember like watching the news and

Comedians and commentators and people

saying like wow I'm on the far left and

I can't believe I agree with like

something Ronda santis said in Florida

which is that like you have to be above

the age of 14 before you can use social

media you need your parents permission

uh at age 14 and 15 and I was wondering

like is that even realistic like is that

something

that can be done I mean we can build it

teens can lie we will build it I mean

we're looking to comply I do think the

situation in the states is complicated

because now states are doing their own

thing and the more variance there is the

harder it is for any platform to comply

and actually execute well and so you're

going to have more and more mistakes and

more and more things s to the cracks I

think it would be good for there to be

parental consent I think though that has

to be an industrywide thing um it can't

just apply to one platform or another I

think it would be good for it to be the

same for all 50 states I think we'll

just make a lot less mistakes um I also

think it would go way better if we get

support from Apple and Google on the

operating systems it is much easier for

me I mean I've got three kids they've

got three iPads each one have has one

it's much easier for me to tell the iPad

that this kid is born in 2016 this kid

is born in 2017 this kid is born in 2020

when I first said it up then for every

app to try and figure out how to do Age

collection age verification and age

prediction on its own and right now I

can ask my phone as an app developer

where is this person in the world right

now to 10 feet can I to listen to their

microphone to turn their camera on but I

can't ask for permission for to know

what their birthday is and that's crazy

and so if we could do that and if you

could do not just Age collection but

also parental control at the operating

system or the App Store level you would

have way less

mistakes I don't know if that's ever

going to happen so we have to do

everything we can to predict age well to

build good parental controls to balance

these different equities that are

intention and we will and I think we do

really well but not as well as we can

we're going to have to get better and

better and better uh but right now I'm

worried that the industry as a whole is

not headed in a direction where you're

not going to have too much slipped

through the cracks

yeah I I want to talk to you about the

future I feel like you you know you

obviously uh H have been on the ground

here and involved with with um Facebook

and and Instagram I think you'd have a

good perspective on where things go in

the future two questions for you about

the future the first has to do with um

Tik Tok if in a year from now

Tik Tok is is gone from the US what does

that mean for

Instagram I mean I can't talk too much

about this one in general I worry about

a world where more and more platforms

are banned in more and more countries

and countries and governments use that

stick as a way to push their own agendas

the vast majority of our business is

outside of the US uh so it would I think

drive more attention not only to

Instagram but to YouTube and other

platforms but it is a step in a more and

more fragmented internet which I think

is probably bad um uh overall now to be

clear it could maybe get sold and you

know there's other paths here I don't

want to guess about what's going to

happen and so without speaking to the

specific band and Tik Tok here in the US

I do worry about a more and more

fragmented

internet I'm curious what you think and

I don't even know how much you can say

but like what is next for social media

in General on this wave because uh there

there's been all of these markers right

of like all right we have Vine we have

really short video uh we have long form

video we have stories we have all these

different fine was just too a little too

early way too early we have all these

different markers of like oh here's a

new instrument we can use even text

right with Twitter and threads it's like

here's a new instrument where we can

communicate yeah what are we on the

precipice of I mean there's going to be

a bunch of different things and I don't

pretend to have a crystal ball I do

think that

I mean the the

current Paradigm shifts I think will

continue for the foreseeable future so

for at least five more years right so

more and more sharing is going to shift

from feed based formats to messaging

based formats um you know You' mentioned

Snapchat before Snapchat is not a

stories product yes they have stories

the vast majority of sharing at Snapchat

is in messages there are way more photos

and messages shared on Instagram in a

given day than posted to stories and

there are way more photos and videos

posted to stories and posted to feed yet

people think of us as a feed app so

you're going to see that continue to

shift um and I think that's interesting

for a number of different reasons I do

think video has not um fully saturated

yet I think you're going to see mobile

video continue to grow probably

primarily driven by short fir video but

what you're really seeing I think is

mobile video Eating into TV's market

share um so we talk a lot about Snapchat

Instagram Tik Tok but the truth is like

we all exist in a much broader ecosystem

in the US the average family watches 5

hours of TV in Western Europe it's three

and India I think it's three or four so

I think you're going to see video

continue to grow so that's kind of a a

Tailwind for digital creators like

yourself I do think you're going to see

um I don't know

how or I don't know exactly what it'll

look like but if you think about every

five years ago there seems to be some

big shift in

how people share that manifests as some

combination of a new format or a new

channel so um you know moving to moving

away from SMS or you know reals and Tik

Tok or before that stories which was

pioneered by snap I think originally

invented by caca um I think we'll

probably see one of those in the next

five years it's probably facilitated by

all of this generative AI I think that a

lot of the stuff that we're looking at

now in that space

will be a little bit cringeworthy in

five years because it's so new but

that's kind of what happens and what's

really exciting about our new technology

is people are just trying things

out and I think we'll also see more and

more this is more further out I don't

know how the social networks are going

to evolve in a world where you've got

more and more sort of ambient not

ambient awareness but more and more time

is going to shift to this format right

like right now we've got the ray B metas

which obviously you know about which by

the way I've been doing really well um

and I think the sleeper feature on those

they're showing up like socially too

like for me as I go out and like people

bring them out and I'm like oh that's

cool like you're enjoying this

experience and sending me videos and

photos after the sneaky feature about

this I think is the speakers in the mic

yeah I do think people are sleeping on

this I wore them for a full day uh the

first time I tried them yeah and by the

end of the day my honest thought uh

because I was skeptical I was like I was

around for Google Glass oh yeah Snapchat

spectacles like all the above but uh

after wearing these for a day my first

thought was these could potentially

replace my iPhone down the line a long

time from in a long time but but it was

the first glimpse of like oh this

product I got really used to just

communicating out loud which felt a

little funny because I was just walking

around talking yeah um but the video

quality is incredible the um audio

quality is incredible and the

perspective is very unique yeah so like

I think these are yeah the mic is also

sneaky good because it's in the nose

Bridge so it's closer to your mouth so

it ends up being better with maybe less

expensive Hardware than like a fancy ear

Ear Pod because it's physically closer

to your mouth so I mean I liked I mean I

don't think Marquez was the first one to

talk about it this way but I kind of

liked his framing when he did that video

about how all of these virtual reality

headsets are trying to come at the

future from this One Direction with this

you know large piece of hardware on your

face but it does everything

and then these are trying to come at it

from the other end which is like all

right they don't there's no screen right

so we can't show you an image you can't

see a

notification but you know there's going

to be more Reliance on voice there's

going to be obviously llms are really

making more audio and Voice driven

interfaces much more practical and much

more human um coming at it from the

other side and so where is it going to

meet in the middle but it's like a lot

of physics challenges right you know

batteries are hard to make small you

know so like how do you have a screen

that you can see through these are like

wild interesting challenges taking

swings in this sector obviously we saw

it with Humane yeah like oh yeah yeah

just like taking swings of like maybe

this is how a wearable works because

like the concept of a screen like this

plus something like that may be kind of

interesting yeah um so that I could then

engage with a screen but who knows where

this goes in the next couple years but I

do find this to be one of the most

compelling pieces of Technology I've

engaged with the thing that's going to

be really interesting to me is I think

in 3 to seven years you're going to see

things that

are for lack of a better analogy halfway

between that and like a quest or a

Vision Pro sure they're not going to be

as slick and you're not going to be as

comfortable wearing them but they're

going to do more of the things and

that'll be interesting because the early

adopters will kind of like dictate that

period but then in like another 3 to 5

years when you can get to something that

feels As Natural to wear as that and

even that's still too heavy um that does

more of what a quest does then things I

get get really interesting and what is

Instagram in that moment right because

if our core jobs are to connect people

around creativity so it's to connect

with friends and connect with your

interests but we come from a visual

Heritage and the primary interface is

actually voice what is it what do we how

do we evolve um if we talked a lot about

cultural relevancy of Instagram if

Instagram in 5 years loses its relevance

what do you think went

wrong we

probably just moved too slow when people

ask me what my biggest concerns are they

almost always lad up to this idea of the

world evolving faster than we can keep

up so you know as you hire more and more

people there's more overhead you move

more slowly as there's more and more

scrutiny there's more and more sort of

risk mitigation functions and processes

you move more slowly as you get more

heavily regulated you move more slowly

um as you become if you become short if

you become too short-term focus on

short-term Revenue you move more slowly

you hold on to the past so it's almost

always the reason why I'm worried about

the thing is I think the world is going

to change faster and faster we've seen

that for all of of human history the

particularly in technology the rate of

innovation has just been increasing and

I think the most likely thing for any

platform of our scale is that eventually

we will just move slower than the world

and the world will move away and we'll

be left in the dust uh and

so what that looks like is harder to

predict but I think if it happens I put

a lot of money on that's why it

happens well Adam I know we have to get
